# Xview2Challenge
In this repo you'll find 2 models: a YoloV5 and a Unet with Attention Gates.

The Yolo model is used for classifcation only whereas the Unet one is used for classification but also for image segmentation.

The dataset used is available on the XView2 challenge website: https://xview2.org

Saved models for the Unet model are too large to be uploaded on this git. But you can find them on the following link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17gIWSk-rLk7pwRp0qgrv6RDBItv_3It6?usp=sharing
